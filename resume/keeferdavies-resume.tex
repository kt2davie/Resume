    \begin{itemize}
    \item Resolved production issues in FileMaker Pro 13, the top selling easy-to-use database software.
    \item Practiced cross-platform development, addressing numerous bugs on Windows and OS X. Efforts were focused on addressing bugs in Script Workspace, the flagship feature in FileMaker Pro 14 (2015 release).
    \item Re-engineered a custom text wrapping algorithm for the new Script Workspace developed with the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Before this new implementation the Script Workspace did not correctly render locales other than English.
    \item Performed Root Cause Analysis (RCA) using Visual Studio to analyze software crash dumps.
    \item Proposed the use of SmartBear's Code Collaborator software to improve on the current code review process. Setup a demo server and presented a live demo to local management and engineers.
    \item Effectively communicated with fellow engineers locally and remotely. The Ottawa office is a small remote engineering office, most other FileMaker engineers are based out of California.
